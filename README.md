## About

This repository is a collection of my implementations and experiments with various data structures and algorithms in Swift. It is organized using Xcode Playgrounds, making it interactive and easy to test and modify.

## Data Structures

The following data structures are implemented in this repository:

- Arrays
- Linked Lists
- Stacks
- Queues
- Trees
- Graphs
- Hash Tables
- Heaps

## Algorithms

The following algorithms are implemented in this repository:

Sorting Algorithms
  - Bubble Sort
  - Insertion Sort
  - Selection Sort
  - Merge Sort
  - Quick Sort

Searching Algorithms
  - Linear Search
  - Binary Search
  - Graph Algorithms:
  - Depth-First Search (DFS)
  - Breadth-First Search (BFS)

Dynamic Programming
  - Fibonacci Sequence
  - Longest Common Subsequence
  - Other Algorithms:
  - Dijkstra's Shortest Path
  - Knuth-Morris-Pratt (KMP) String Matching

## Examples

Here are some example usages of the data structures and algorithms:

```swift
Copy code
// Example of Binary Search
let array = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
if let index = binarySearch(array, target: 5) {
    print("Element found at index \(index)")
} else {
    print("Element not found")
}

// Example of Merge Sort
let unsortedArray = [3, 6, 1, 8, 4, 5]
let sortedArray = mergeSort(unsortedArray)
print("Sorted Array: \(sortedArray)")
```
